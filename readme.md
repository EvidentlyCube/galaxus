## How to build the project

Open `build.cmd` in your text editor, update `MXMLC_PATH` variable with the path to Flex SDK (it should support at least Flash Player 10.1), and then run `build.cmd`. If you're on a non-windows o/s the commands used in the file should still work fine so you can use them as basis.
